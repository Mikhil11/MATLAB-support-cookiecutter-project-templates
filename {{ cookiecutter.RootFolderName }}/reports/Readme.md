# MATLAB Reports

This folder contains various MATLAB reports that you can generate using the provided scripts and functions. These reports are designed to help you analyze and visualize data, assess code coverage, and track the performance of your MATLAB toolbox.

## Available Reports

[Test Coverage Report][1]: This report provides insights into the code coverage achieved by your MATLAB toolbox's test suite. It helps you identify areas of your code that are not adequately covered by tests, allowing you to improve the overall quality and reliability of your toolbox.

[Code Analyzer][2]: The performance report allows you to measure and analyze the execution time of critical functions or algorithms in your MATLAB toolbox. By identifying bottlenecks and areas for optimization, you can enhance the efficiency and speed of your code.

## Use buildtool to create all your reports

The user can add the custom functions in the [buildfile](../buildfile.m) provided within the toolbox template

Open MATLAB and navigate to the root directory of your MATLAB toolbox.

Run the corresponding function to generate the report you need.

Use reports folder to save all the generated reports. You can open the report using a web browser or any other suitable software.

## Additional Information

For more details on how to use the provided scripts and functions for report generation, please refer to the documentation included in the buildfile. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out to the toolbox's support team.

We hope these reports help you analyze, improve, and document your MATLAB toolbox effectively. Happy coding!
