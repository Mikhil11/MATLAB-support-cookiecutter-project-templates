# MATLAB Reports

This folder contains various MATLAB reports that you can generate using the provided scripts and functions. These reports are designed to help you analyze and visualize data, assess code coverage, and track the performance of your MATLAB toolbox.

## Available Reports

Test Coverage Report: This report provides insights into the code coverage achieved by your MATLAB toolbox's test suite. It helps you identify areas of your code that are not adequately covered by tests, allowing you to improve the overall quality and reliability of your toolbox.

Performance Report: The performance report allows you to measure and analyze the execution time of critical functions or algorithms in your MATLAB toolbox. By identifying bottlenecks and areas for optimization, you can enhance the efficiency and speed of your code.

Code Complexity Report: This report helps you assess the complexity of your MATLAB code. It provides metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, function size, and nesting levels, enabling you to identify areas that may be difficult to understand, test, or maintain.

Code Documentation Report: This report generates documentation for your MATLAB code, making it easier for other developers to understand and use your toolbox. It includes information about functions, classes, inputs, outputs, and usage examples.

Code Style Report: The code style report ensures that your MATLAB code follows recommended coding conventions and guidelines. It checks for issues such as indentation, variable naming, function length, and unused variables, helping you maintain a consistent and readable codebase.

## How to Generate Reports

To generate any of the above reports, follow these steps:

Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.

Open MATLAB and navigate to the root directory of your MATLAB toolbox.

Run the corresponding report generation script or function provided in the toolbox. Each report has its own script or function dedicated to generating it.

The generated report will be saved in the respective subdirectory within the reports folder. You can open the report using a web browser or any other suitable software.

## Additional Information

For more details on how to use the provided scripts and functions for report generation, please refer to the documentation included in the toolbox. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out to the toolbox's support team.

We hope these reports help you analyze, improve, and document your MATLAB toolbox effectively. Happy coding!

Please note that this is just a sample README file, and you can modify it according to your specific requirements.
