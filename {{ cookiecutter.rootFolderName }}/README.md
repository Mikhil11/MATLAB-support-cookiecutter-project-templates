## Getting started with {{ cookiecutter.RootFolderName }} Toolbox

## How to use the toolbox functions:

```matlab:Code
%% Provide description about the toolbox function and provide an example for it
x = 2;
y = 3;
a =  addVariable(x,y);
disp(a)
b = subtractVariable(x,y);
disp(b)
```

## How to analyse and visualize the results (If any):

```matlab:Code
% Use MATLAB functions which user can  use to visualize data(if any)
x = 0:pi/100:2*pi;
y = sin(x);
plot(x,y)
```
